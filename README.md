# Imdb-Scrapper

I have scrapped 250 movies using beautifulSoup libary .
I have used basic pyton like if-else , loops , list , dictionary , function , fileSystem and requests, json.
When i scrappe data then i save data in json file becase if i not save data then i have gone server then it will take more time.
I learn how to scrape mini things in website, and how to inspect data e.t.c.
